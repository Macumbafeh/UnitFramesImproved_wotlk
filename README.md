# UnitFramesImproved_wotlk

This is a simplistic unitframes addon.

Macumba's modified version
- The healthText and the name position, scale and font of the Player / target and Focus Frame,
- Fixed the Focus Frame texture
- Removed the PvPIcon of Target and focus frames
- Increased the Size of the Party frames (1.6) and the Player's Buffs (1.6) (Near the minimap - delete "BuffFrame:SetScale(1.6)" in the code if you don't want it)
- Added Black border for all the frames, but i kept the Elite texture
- Removed Class color health for Enemies players
- Added Party Class color in the code, but it's disabled
- Removed the text format of health (like 11k instead of 11000)
